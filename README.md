## terbilang.js
Purpose of this program is to produce human readable string from float.

#### Performance
The performance observed is around O(n).

#### Example :

  * A float of 1000 would produce string "One thousand"

  * A float of 1234 would produce string "One thousand two hundred thirthy four"

  * Etc, but currently only made in bahasa, you could alter Terbilang.units and other array string to your language

#### Usage
Include the javascript file with script tag and insert it wherever you need. The js only need vanilla javascript library and only take two global variable name (i.e. _\_Terbilang_ and _Terbilang_).

```javascript 
Terbilang.apa(float) // <fn, string> to produce full string
Terbilang.format(float) // <fn, string> to produce string with set delimiter:
                        //              Terbilang.delimiter and Terbilang.decimalDelimiter.
Terbilang.koma(float) // <fn, string> to produce human readable decimal string.
Terbilang.PRESISI_DESIMAL // <integer> (default to 2) to set Decimal precision.
Terbilang.delimiter // <char> with value of '.' or ','
Terbilang.decimalDelimiter // <char> with value of '.' or ','
```

## tictactoe.js

#### Usage
Include the javascript file with script tag and insert it wherever you need. The js only need vanilla javascript library and only take one global variable name (i.e _TicTacToe_)

Also the javascript need some tweaking with button array id which will be stored in _TicTacToe.boardid_ that comprise sorted ids incrementally from 0 = top left most button to 8 = right bottom most button. 

Localization could also be done by altering _TicTacToe.infostr_ which now is currently filled with string in bahasa.

_TicTacToe.infoid_ should set accordingly to tag which will containt information about event in the game.
